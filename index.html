    <h3>About the site:</h3>
    <p>
      On the site users are able to display the amount of workforce and the
      amount of new summer houses in years 1980-2019 by municipality. Workforces
      status is displayed as it was at the end of decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purpose of the data is to present how the workforce is moving to larger
      cities and smaller municipalities are becoming "summer house villages".
      However this is not always the case and there are interesting developments
      across the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the map the development between decades 2000-2009 and 2010-2019 is
      displayed with colors. Summer house layer uses fill colors. The red color
      means that less than 50% of summer houses were built than the decade
      before. Green color means that more summer houses were built than a decade
      before. Yellow color marks the status between aforementioned colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the workforce, similar colors are used but the outline of the
      municipality is colored. Red color is used when the workforce has dropped
      below 80% of the level of the last decade. Green and yellow are used
      similarly as in the summer house layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users are able to display either workforce or summerhouses individually or
      both simultaneously by selecting layers from the upper right corner of the
      map. By default both layers are presented on top of each other.
